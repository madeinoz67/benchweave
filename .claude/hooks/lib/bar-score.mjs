// bar-score.mjs — advisory noise-bar feedback for memory proposals (issue #420).
//
// The memory protocol's bar (durable, non-obvious, not recoverable elsewhere) was prose;
// the validator could only check shape. This module scores a proposal batch against the
// bar's three dimensions in ONE judgment call and returns a line of feedback.
//
// It is advisory BY DESIGN and cannot do anything else: it returns a string. It never
// throws, never blocks, never edits the records — the protocol measured what happens
// when a gate sits on this path (the retracted recall-and-HOLD gate, four defects) and
// the lesson is written there: advice at the producer, dumb pipe everywhere else.
