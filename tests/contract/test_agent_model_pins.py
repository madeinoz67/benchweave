"""Declaration completeness of the review-lane model pins (``.claude/agents/*.md``).

Issue #519: the review rubric's G6 lane says each refute run's model is whatever
the installation resolves the agent's DECLARED pin to — that claim presupposes
every agent definition declares a ``model:`` line, and this test is what makes
the presupposition regenerable instead of assumed.

What this test does NOT catch:
- Same-pin convergence: two lanes declaring the same pin is an owner-accepted
  posture (``adversary`` and ``increment-builder`` both pin ``opus``) — this
  test never compares pins.
- Vendor identity: which vendor an installation resolves a pin to is an
  installation property, invisible to repository state — no in-repo test can
  catch it.
- Presence-only: all that is proved is a declared value on a ``model:`` line
  in each frontmatter. That the pin names a real alias (the repo holds no
  authority for the alias set), or that the declared pin served any given
  run, is not proved.
- A vendor-named or misspelled pin passes; the declaration is the
  precondition, not the value.
